# Yamete Kudasai

Cute anime girl moaning when something is plugged in.

## Getting Started

> Android only

I think the sentence above says all about the app...

When you enter the app, just click start and whenever an event happens one of the precisely chosen sounds gets played.
If you want to turn off the sound playing for a specific event, just toggle off the button behind it.
For playing other sounds than the standard "Yamete Kudasai", click on the entry for the event you want to change
and a new window pops up where you can set the sound which should be played on the event.

Supported events:
- **Battery**
  - Battery charging
  - Battery discharging
  - Battery full
- **Headphone**
  - Headphone connected
  - Headphone disconnected
